# How to register Pix key 

A **Pix key** is, as the [Banco Central do Brasil](https://www.bcb.gov.br/estabilidadefinanceira/pix) (BCB) calls, a “*nickname*” used to identify your account in a financial transaction. 

With it, you no longer need to inform the number of your bank account and agency. The only information needed is your Pix key. 

The 4 types of Pix keys you may use are:

* CPF/CNPJ 
* Email
* Cell phone number
* Random key

> 🚩Important: You can’t use the same Pix key in two different institutions. 

To register your Pix key:

1. Open your bank app in your cell phone,
2. Click in “_**Área Pix**_”,
